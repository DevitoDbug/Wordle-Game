# Wordle!
Welcome to Wordle, a daily word guessing game where you try to guess the word of the day! Each day, a new word will be generated for you to guess, so make sure to come back and play every day.

## Installation
To play the game, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The game requires an internet connection to fetch the word of the day from https://words.dev-apis.com/word-of-the-day, so make sure you have an active internet connection.

## How to Play
To play, simply type in your guess for the word of the day in the input field and hit enter. The game will check your answer and give you feedback, letting you know if you've guessed the right letters or if they're in the wrong position. Keep guessing until you've guessed the entire word, or until you run out of guesses!

## Technologies Used
This game was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches the word of the day from https://words.dev-apis.com/word-of-the-day using the fetch API.

## Future Improvements
1. Add a scoreboard to keep track of high scores
2. Allow users to choose a difficulty level
3. Improve the UI and overall user experience
4. Check if the user's guess is a valid English five-letter word before validating the guess
